# Project-7ACHYON
Purpose: an entry to the ECES-IECEP UE-Caloocan ASICUP Competition

A high-speed line follower robot equipped with a 3-channel sensor array for accurate path tracking. Programmed using efficient truth-table logic, it delivers quick, stable, and precise responses, making it an ideal platform for testing speed optimization and control algorithms in autonomous navigation.

Details of project construction are demonstrated on the Wiki section of this repository.
